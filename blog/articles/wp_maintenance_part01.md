# Error logs in wp-config

## Turn on error logging

First, you'll have to edit your wp-config file, open the file and look for the line that says *Thatâ€™s all, stop editing! Happy blogging.*

Just before this line you need to add the following code:

```
define ( 'WP_DEBUG', true );
```

This will turn on the WordPress debug mode with the downside that all errors will be displayed on your screens, including wp-admin area.

While this is ok for development environment it would not be a good idea for production.

## Error logging in production environment

If you want errors to be logged, then you will also need to add the following code in your wp-config file, just below the WP_DEBUG line.

```
define ( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );
define ( 'WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false );
```

This will save all the errors, warnings and notices that were encountered in a debug.log file in /wp-content/ folder.

That way you can safely tackle the issues behind the scene.
