Is it possible for him to work until 65 years old? Will his career years end earlier? How should he plan for retirement?</a>
            <p>The best software engineers can work into their 80s, but it takes a lot of focus to stay relevant after 60 years. 65 is achievable, but by no means guaranteed. 55 is more probable.<br>It is thus a good idea for a software developer to spend less than he earns over a whole lifetime, to increase the chance that he can retire whenever he finds he can’t get work. And if hubby needs to spend time alone learning new stuff, let him. He’s trying to stay fresh.</p><br><br>

            <p>My cars are fairly cheap and paid off. Aside from visiting my wife's family, most of my travel is local. My hobbies are cheap. It's easy to rack up big expenses through expensive travel, fancy clothes, race cars, boats, and a big house in the city, but I'd rather retire early.</p><br><br>

            <p>The best you can do is go to college to get a good paying job, and then live frugally, saving money until you figure you have enough to retire on. That might be 35, but it’s more likely to be 65.</p><br><br>

            <p>They lose a job during their fifties, one of many they’ve lost after a project completed or an economic downturn occurred, and have to retire because no one wants to hire an “old” software developer.</p><br><br>
