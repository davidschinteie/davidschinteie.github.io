# SSH commands every developer should know

## 1. Add your ssh key to server 

### Method 1: Manually copy the public ssh key to the server

    Step 1 Get your local ssh-key
    ```
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ```
    Step 2 Create ssh directory & authorized_keys file if not exists
    ```
    mkdir -p /home/user_name/.ssh
    touch /home/user_name/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```
    Step 3 Edi authorized_keys file with your own ssh-key
    ```
    vim /home/user_name/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```
### Method 2: Automatically copy the ssh key to server

```
ssh-copy-id user@hostname.example.com
```

Note: while this method seems the go to option, there are use cases where you can't use it (like adding someone else's ssh key or root ssh isn't available from your machine)
You should be able to use both.

## 2. Add a user to group command 

```
useradd -g www-data foo // add a new user named foo to www-data group
usermod -a -G www-data bar // Add an existing user bar to Apacheâ€™s www-data group on Ubuntu

grep ^www-data /etc/group // to see list of all members of a group named www-data
```

### 2.1 www-data directories permisions for a different user

If you have a directory in /var/www (called cake) and you need to allow www-data to write to it, but also user-admin want to write to it (without having to use sudo):

```
sudo chown -R user-admin:www-data cake
sudo chmod -R g+s cake
```

First command changes owner and group.

Second command adds s attribute which will keep new files and directories within cake having the same group permissions.
